# hyggecoin

A basic implementation of a bitcoin-like cryptocurrency, along with some slack bot tools to give coins through slack. Hosted at http://hyggecoin.herokuapp.com/.


The cryptocurrency was implemented by roughly following [this](https://lhartikk.github.io/) tutorial.

## Setup

Run yarn in the root folder to install dependencies for the server, and in the client folder to install dependencies for the client.
Create a .env file based on the .env.sample file found in the root folder.
